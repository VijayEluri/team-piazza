Piazza is a build monitor plugin for the Team City continuous integration server. Piazza provides a high-visibility display of the current state of the build to alert the team as soon as the build breaks.

For any build, Piazza displays:

-The project and build name
-The current build number
-Whether the build is "red" or "green"
-Textual success/failure indication for the colour-blind
-Whether the Team City server is currently building
-The changes that caused the current build to be kicked off
-Pictures of the team members that made those changes
-The progress of the build
-The build step that the Team City agent is currently running
-The number of passed, failed and ignored tests
-Piazza can also display an overview of all the builds in a project.
